I am a final year PhD student in Computer Science department at University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. I am associated with the scientific computing group and work at [LPNA](http://lpna.cs.illinois.edu) under the supervision of [Edgar Solomonik](https://solomonik.cs.illinois.edu). I completed my MS in Applied Mathematics from University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign and B.Tech in Mathematics and Computing from [Delhi Technological University](http://dtu.ac.in/Web/Academics/bacheloroftechnology.php).

My research interests keep evolving and currently include numerical linear and multilinear algebra, high performance computing, and numerical optimization.
I love to explore problems at the intersection of computer science and mathematics.

Here is my [CV](https://navjo2323.github.io/_pages/CV.pdf).
